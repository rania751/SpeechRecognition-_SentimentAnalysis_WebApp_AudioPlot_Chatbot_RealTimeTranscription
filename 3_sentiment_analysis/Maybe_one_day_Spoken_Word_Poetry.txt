Maybe one day I'll learn to smile for pictures maybe one day I'll have a dream maybe one day I'll learn what love is. Maybe one day I'll have a purpose maybe one day I learned what happiness is. Maybe one day I'll wake up different but until then, I'll keep imagining living my life because it's better than living it.
