the main goal from this project is to build a pretty web app using streamlit
we take the id for an episod of a prodcast from the listnote database and the it gives all informations needed 
we use the auto_chapters from assemblyai which takes the podcast and devide it to chapters 
 
 output:
 2files:
 .txt:the transcription of the podcast
 .json:the informations about the podcast(chapters created by the auto_chapters feature with its parameters / audio_url/thumbnail/podcast_title/episode_title)
 this informations are integrated in the web app
