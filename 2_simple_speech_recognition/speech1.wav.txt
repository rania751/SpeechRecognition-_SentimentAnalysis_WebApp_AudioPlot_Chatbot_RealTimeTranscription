If you only have 24 hours in a day. Your success is dependent upon how you use the 24. You got to hear me. People talk about Oprah Winfrey. 
You know, Ted Turner, Warren Buffett. Listen to me. I don't care how much money you make. You only get 24 hours in a day. 
And the difference between Oprah and the person that's broke is oprah uses her 24 hours wisely. That's it. Listen to me. That's it. 
You get 24 I don't care if you broke. You grew up broke. I don't care if you grew up rich. I don't care if you're in college. 
You're not in college. You only get 24 hours. And I blew up. Literally. 
I went from being a high school dropout to selling 6000 books in less than six months. 
What happened in my 24 hours? I was like, okay, Eric, you got to get a grip on your 24 hours, because you bought to be broke for the rest of your life. 
And that's all I need you to do for me. I can tell you all about your life if you just write down your 24 hours schedule for me. You let me look at it. 
I can tell you where you're going to be in five years. I can tell you what or you're going to be in ten years. 
I can tell you where you're going to be in 20 years if you keep that schedule.
