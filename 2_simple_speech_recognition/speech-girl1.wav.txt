Maybe one day I learned to smile for pictures. Maybe one day I'll have a dream. Maybe one day I'll learn what love is. Maybe one day I'll have a purpose. Maybe one day I learned what happiness is. Maybe one day I'll wake up different. But until then I'll keep imagining living my life because it's far away. Better than living it.
