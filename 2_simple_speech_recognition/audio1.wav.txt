Life is weird. Life is not logic. 
It's like we just woke up someday and here we are. 
Life can be painful, tragical, boring and void of meaning. 
Life can be fatholous, amazing, awesome and full of meaning. 
It's all up to you. You're the one who choose what kind of path you take. 
It's going to be hard. Pay in full. You will face so many losses. 
You will never have a peace of mind until you reach your dreams, your goals, 
your designer. Don't think about the future. Think about now. What you're going to do to make things right. 
What you're going to do to achieve your goals, your dreams. If you don't have the answer now, it's okay. 
Just breathe out. Once you have the answer, make a plan A and B and so on. I don't care. Failure is not an option. 
Put yourself together and breathe. Get the job done and good luck. Thanks for the.
